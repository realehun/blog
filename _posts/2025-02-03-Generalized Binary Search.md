## 1. Problem Statement

The standard binary search involves, at each time step, in a sorted array, partitioning the array into 2 halves about the middle number and pruning one of them based on the fact whether our search number is greater or less than the middle number. 

1. First why split in the middle only? 

2. Imagine the array has duplicates is the middle still the best? A better way to formulate our problem is using probability - ...
